The game is a product of a research paper entitled "An Interactive Color Identifying Game for Children utilizing Voice Recognition that implements Dynamic Time Warping AY2022-2023"

## Abstract

<summary>What's the reason about the games creation?</summary>
<br>
 <p align = "justify">
  Shows like Blues Clues and Dora The Explorer have always been adored by the children
due to their unique way of keeping their attention. The said shows would ask its viewers simple
questions that are related to what is being shown on the screen, as if the characters of the show
are interacting with its audience in real time. The only downside of this is that it is only an
illusion and it does not have any feedback to its audience regardless of the answer given. This
study aims to create an interactive color identifying game that utilizes a voice recognition system
that is aimed towards children; the accuracy of the algorithm will be tested along with the
duration of the childrenâ€™s attention span towards the duration of the game.
  
  To achieve this, the voice recognition system would use an algorithm called Dynamic
Time Warping wherein the waveforms of the audio files will be compared instead of the
pronunciation. The children will be playing the game, at the same time, a facilitator takes note of
the childrenâ€™s answer and see if the children said the corresponding color shown on the screen,
this will be later compared to the results of the algorithm and cross-referenced. The game will
automatically log the respondentâ€™s playtime along with the results of the algorithm.

  After playtesting, the study yielded a significant difference in the result of the algorithm
and input of the facilitator with an accuracy of 72.91%; and the average duration of the
respondentâ€™s attention to the game was found to be around 6.64 minutes. Based on the results,
the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm has proven to be an effective algorithm in recognizing the
voice input of the children, even though some of the respondents did not have clear
pronunciation and intonation of the color name. Additionally, the game has shown to be able to
keep the attention of the children throughout the playtesting, despite some of the teachers in the
school mentioning that the current player has a short attention span; the respondents played in an
optimal length of time in which they are focused enough to properly play the game.
